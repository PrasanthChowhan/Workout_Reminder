No problem, I can help you with a calisthenics workout routine that uses only your body weight and targets one muscle group per session. Calisthenics is a form of exercise that involves using your own body weight as resistance to build strength, endurance, and flexibility. It can be done anywhere, anytime, and with minimal equipment. Here are some examples of calisthenics exercises for different muscle groups:

- Chest: You can do push-ups, which are a classic calisthenics exercise that work your chest, triceps, and shoulders. You can vary the difficulty by changing the width of your hands, the elevation of your feet, or the speed of your reps. A possible routine is:

    - Normal push-ups: 3 sets of 10 reps, with 30 seconds rest between sets.
    - Wide arm push-ups: 3 sets of 10 reps, with 30 seconds rest between sets.
    - Decline push-ups: 3 sets of 10 reps, with 30 seconds rest between sets.

    - Pike push-ups: 3 sets of 8 reps, with 30 seconds rest between sets.
